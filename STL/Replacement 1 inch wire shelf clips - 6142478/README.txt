Replacement 1 inch wire shelf clips by TRyanRogers1 on Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6142478

Summary:
These models are capable of replacing the two-part wire shelf/baker's rack mounting clips like these for a standard 1" shelving unit. (See first image for part to be replaced). These clips really will do the trick, just be a little gentler while getting them in place. Once all 4 corners of your shelf are in place, you should be able to put good pressure on these prints without them slipping. In the filenames, the "_###d" refers to the number of degrees that clip model encompasses. For example, "_240d" means the clip is 240 degrees of a full circle. I actually found that all of these models would do the job; though the 240d model would seem to be the best choice since it provides more contact with the shelf posts. I recommend adjusting your extrusion width to get an integer number of walls/perimeters near the bottom (see sample GCODE image). On my Prusa Mini, I didn't even need a brim to print 4 of these in one go; though most printers would probably benefit from a brim. In PLA, these models had enough flex to snap on and off the shelves easily by hand.Just like the two-part commercial clips, these have a slight taper, a beveled/rounded top edge, and an indexing ring near the top on the inside.
