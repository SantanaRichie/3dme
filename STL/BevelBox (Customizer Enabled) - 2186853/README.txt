BevelBox (Customizer Enabled) by erik_wrenholt on Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2186853

Summary:
BevelBox is a parametric box designed with OpenSCAD for a 0.4mm nozzle. I've successfully printed it with a Monoprice Select Mini printer at 0.21875 layer height, sliced with Cura. With a margin of 0.1, the box stays shut pretty well just with friction. The example pictured was printed with Hatchbox glow in the dark PLA.This is my first published thing, so let me know how it works for you if you print it.I enabled Customizer for this design so you can make a box any size you want.
