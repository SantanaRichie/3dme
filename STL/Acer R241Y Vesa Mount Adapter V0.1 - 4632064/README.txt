Summary:
--New Version-- https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6708254--above--Saw jbman's vesa mount (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2898774) and didn't like that it was sticking out so far from under the monitor. So I decided to give my own design a go.The mount should be attached with M5 screws and uses the original mounting plate + screws from the monitor stand.
